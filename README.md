# Hello, strangers!! ٩꒰ʘʚʘ๑꒱۶

I'm Kortney, a junior STEM major building a hands on coding portfolio. My current focus is Python and cybersecurity, with growing interest in digital forensics and secure systems. I’m also exploring game development with C++ and C# using the Godot engine.

Right now, I’m starting small with Python based tools and forensic simulations, because learning a language is one thing, applying it to real world problems is another!In the meantime, feel free to check out some of my other work: 
- [HTML/CSS/JAVASCRIPT_personal_portfolio](https://github.com/kokonutzlabs/Portfolio-Site)
- [CYBER_FORENSICS_nook_book_setup](https://github.com/kokonutzlabs/Nook-Book)

## Hard Skills
Languages: Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C++, PHP, SQL

Systems: Linux (Ubuntu, Kali), Git, VS Code, Shell, Windows

Tools: Git, GitHub, VS Code, Shell, SAP ERP

Security: Log analysis, threat modeling, basic forensics

Other: Power BI, automation scripting, basic networking

## My Goals
1. Build Python tools for cybersecurity and forensic analysis
2. Learn C++ and C# for game development
3. Create secure, resilient systems in warehouse environments
4. Keep growing this portfolio with real world creative projects
