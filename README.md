I'm Kortney, a junior STEM major building a hands on coding portfolio. My current focus is Python and cybersecurity, with growing interest in digital forensics and secure systems. I’m also exploring game development with C++ and C# using the Godot engine.

Right now, I’m starting small with Python based tools and forensic simulations, because learning a language is one thing, applying it to real world problems is another!In the meantime, feel free to check out some of my other work:
