I'm a junior STEM major working on building my coding portfolio. My goal is to become proficient in Python, and eventually dive into C++ and C# to develop video games using Godot.

Right now, Iâ€™m starting small with Python projects, because learning a language is one thing, applying it is another! In the meantime, feel free to check out some of my other work:
